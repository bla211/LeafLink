# Leaflink Code Challenge

## Prerequisites
* [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)


## Get started

Unzip the zip file and `cd` into the project directory. Then:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Open up *http://localhost:8080/* in your browser. Any code in the `public/` folder will be served. 


## Overview

The candidate will build an _invoice generator_. Please see the [attached mocks](./resources/mocks.sketch) for design guidelines, and read these instructions carefully.

* Use the [attached mocks](./resources/mocks.sketch) for design guidance. These are not detailed designs, only a rough sketch that you may fill in as needed
* Line items should have _description_, _quantity_, _rate_ and _total_ fields
* Ability to _add_ or _remove_ line items as needed
* Provisions for _sub-total_, _taxes_ and _deductions_ fields
* Add any other fields, requirements as needed
* Your submission should be responsive, with a *small* and a *large* breakpoint
* Please ensure that your submission looks good across all viewport sizes!
* Feel free to use any Javascript frameworks or libraries you are comfortable with
* Feel free to include any CSS pre-compilers you are comfortable with
* _Chrome compliance is all that's required_. All functions and features available in Chrome are in play.

Nice to haves (not required but things to think about):

* Adherence to accessibility standards
* Documentation
* Tests


## Deliverables

Please package your submission up into a zip file. _Do not include node_modules folders in the zip_. We should be able to unzip your submission and run it via:

```
$ npm i && npm start
```
